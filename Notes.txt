Personal loan  API
	Apply for personal loan
	Get loan by ID
	Get all loans for a customer
	Loan approval / rejection
	
Calculate EMI  API
	API that accept (Loan amount,Interest rate,Tenure)
	API that return (EMI, Total interest, Total payment)
	
The API should:
	Accept a repayment for a loan
	Validate payment amount
	Update outstanding balance
	Update EMI schedule
	Change loan status when fully paid
	Store transaction history
	

====================================TASK=======================================	

/tasks	 break down plan into actionable  steps

		
		=======================================================		
		Data Model
			Design entities:
				Customer
				Loan
				EMI Schedule
				Repayment Transaction
		

		Personal Loan API
		========================================================
		
		 Apply for Personal Loan:
			Design loan request payload (customerId, amount, tenure, interestRate, etc.)
			Validate input data
			Check customer eligibility rules (optional/business rule)
			Create loan record with status = PENDING
			Generate repayment schedule (EMI plan)
			Persist loan + schedule in DB
			Return loan application response

		 Get Loan by ID
			Create endpoint to fetch loan by loanId
			Validate loanId
			Fetch loan details from DB
			Include:
				Loan summary
				Outstanding balance
				EMI schedule
				Status
			Return response DTO

		  
		  Get All Loans for a Customer
			Create endpoint using customerId
			Validate customerId
			Fetch all loans mapped to customer
			Add pagination & sorting (recommended)
			Return loan list with summary info

		  Loan Approval / Rejection
			Create approval/rejection endpoint
			Validate loan exists & is in PENDING
			Add authorization check (admin/credit officer)
			Update loan status:
				APPROVED → activate EMI schedule
				REJECTED → store reason
			Store decision metadata (approvedBy, date, remarks)
			Trigger events/notifications (optional)

	 
	 EMI Calculation API
	 ==================================================================================
	 
		Request Handling
			Create endpoint accepting:
				Loan amount
				Interest rate
				Tenure
				
		EMI Calculation Logic
			Implement EMI formula
			Calculate:
				EMI amount
				Total interest
				Total payment
				
		Response
			Return calculated values
			
	
	Loan Repayment API
	=================================================================================
	
		Accept Repayment:
			Create repayment endpoint
			Validate:
				Loan exists
				Loan is ACTIVE
				Payment > 0

		Validate Payment Amount
			Check for:
				Overpayment handling rule
				Partial payment support
				EMI due vs advance payment logic
			Apply business rules


		Update Outstanding Balance
			Deduct paid amount
			Recalculate remaining principal
			Update next EMI dues


		Update EMI Schedule
			Mark EMI as:
					PAID (full payment)
					PARTIALLY_PAID
			Adjust future EMIs if prepayment happens (if supported)

		
		Change Loan Status When Fully Paid
			Detect balance = 0
			Update status → CLOSED
			Set closure date
			Stop future EMI generation



		Store Transaction History
			Create repayment transaction entity
			Store:
				transactionId
				loanId
				amount
				payment date
				payment mode
				reference number
